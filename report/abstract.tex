\section*{Abstract}
This paper documents and discusses our solutions to a project accompanying the ETH's \emph{Software Verification} course in autumn semester 2015, consisting of verifying two programs - one written in Eiffel and verified with AutoProof, one written and verified in Boogie - as well as he problems encountered as during the project and how we resolved the issues. Comparing our experiences with the two tools, we also briefly discuss why we preferred AutoProof over Boogie and why we still think that AutoProof may not be the answer to all program verification needs.\\
